End of Semester Data Roundup

## What we'll talk about

- What the heck is an API?  
- What the heck is web scraping?  
- What's a free tool for easily creating embeddable data-driven visuals?

---

# APIs

Application Program Interfaces

---

## APIs

- Bottom line: a way for computers to talk to other computers
- Almost always returns data as [JSON](https://www.dataquest.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/json.svg)
- GET, POST, PUT, DELETE commands 
- Just worry about GET
- Almost always involves creating a URL link 

---

## APIs

- Let's try one out using a [dummy API](http://dummy.restapiexample.com/)
- We'll also use an online [JSON converter](https://codebeautify.org/jsonviewer) to parse into readable format, e.g. csv
- Another [second dummy API](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/)

# Web Scraping

Pulling data from a website structure

---

## Web scraping

- If there's an API, you don't need to scrape at all. Yay!
- Some websites actually have [tables](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MSFT/history?p=MSFT) in them you can copy/pase directly into Excel
- If that's not possible though, that's when you'd want to consider scraping
- Let's take a look at this page of [taco listings](https://www.yellowpages.com/search?search_terms=tacos&geo_location_terms=Washington%2C+DC) for example
- We'll use the "developer tools" of the browser to explore
