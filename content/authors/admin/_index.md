Aaron Kessler is an award-winning journalist, teacher and project leader specializing in investigative reporting and data analysis at the intersection of business and politics. 

He has nearly 20 years of experience as an investigative reporter, data journalist and newsroom innovator covering a range of complex government and business subjects including politics, health care, finance, technology, transportation, housing and education.

Aaron doubles as both a seasoned shoe-leather reporter and writer, as well as an industry-leading data practitioner and coder. He uses those combined skills to discover stories, uncover new knowledge and share the truth behind critical issues of public importance.

He's especially a fan of R, though uses a wide range of data tools and programming strategies, and loves conceptualizing and building data-driven interactive experiences for news audiences.

Additionally, he's led projects and initiatives to develop more innovative journalism workflows and to create tools aimed at harnessing the power of code within the newsroom. 

Aaron's a Certified Scrum Master who believes self-organized, empowered teams can fuel innovation not just in technology-driven settings but also for news reporting projects. He completed the elite Knight-Bagehot Fellowship in Business & Economics Journalism, a one year program of full-time MBA coursework at Columbia Business School for rigorous training in finance, management and leadership.

He's also a longtime member of Investigative Reporters & Editors, for which he served on the board of directors and frequently speaks and leads training sessions. He also taught data journalism at The George Washington University for nearly 10 years.
